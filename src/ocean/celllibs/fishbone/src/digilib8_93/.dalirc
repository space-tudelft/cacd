# turn off visibility of some nasty masks: od, sn, sp, nw, cb, bb
visible od off
visible sn off

# link the contact masks which contact to poly/diffusion
# in thsi way these masks will always switch on or off together

# for convenience: turn layer metal1 on
layer in on

# when reading a new cell: automatically expand until the bottom
default_expansion 9

# draw all instances hashed, to indicate level

#
# start drawing dominant (better for SoG structure)

# Turn on image mode:
# auto-snap all instances to grid during move or add

# switch the tracker window off
tracker off

# Display the grid

# Do not display the instances of the 'primitives' library

# set drawing order for domniant drawing
# The layer with the lowest number will be drawn last
# All missing layers will be drawn transparent, UNDER the dominant layers

# set the maximum number of image cells which should be drawn on the
# screen, to prevent endless drawing (default: 120)

# set the cell name, using which seadali can detect whether this is
# a via. Vianames will not be drawn. Only the first 3 characters are
# significant. (Default: via)
