print dali initialisation for 'fishbone' Sea-of-Gates image

# when reading a new cell: automatically expand until the bottom
default_expansion 9

# draw all instances hashed, to indicate level
hashed on

# turn of some nasty masks: od, sn, sp, nw, cb
visible od off
visible sn off
visible sp off
visible nw off
visible cb off
# turn also the bb mask off (which contains alignment markers)
visible bb off

# for convenience: turn layer metal1 on
layer in on

# Start drawing dominant (better for SoG structure)
dominant on

# set drawing order if dominant is on
# The layer with the lowest number will be drawn last
# All missing layers will be drawn transparent, UNDER the dominant layers

# Some customizations for seadali
#
# set instance name of the image, for special treatment by
# seadli (default: IMAGE)
# imagename IMAGE

# setb the maximum number of image cells which should be drawn on the
# screen, to prevent endless drawing (default: 120)
# maxdraw 80

# sea the cell name, using which seadali can detect whether this is
# a via. Vianames will not be drawn. Only the first 3 characters are
# significant. (Default: via)
# vianame via
