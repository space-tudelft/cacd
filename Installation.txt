			INSTALLATION
			============

When you read this "Installation.txt" file, you have successfull downloaded
the "cacd" repository from GitHub in your "cacd" directory.

Note that this is Public Domain software and only usefull for PCs running Linux.
Note that other releases and information can be found on the Space website:

	http://www.space.tudelft.nl

This file describes how to install the layout-to-circuit extractor 'space',
including several other IC design tools like the layout editor 'dali', the
switch-level simulator 'sls' and the network comparison program 'match'.
And also is included the OCEAN placement and routing software.
And included the Berkeley SPICE analogue network simulator.
And the TU Delft design practicum software.

For a detailed description of the use of the tools, see the users manuals that
are present in directory "cacd/share/doc" and the manual pages that can be
obtained by executing the command 'icdman toolname'. But, because this is
a source distribution, first the tools must be build.

For license and warranty information, please consult the "LICENSE" file
in the "cacd" source main installation directory.


Making the tools
----------------

Making the tools must be done in the "cacd" main installation directory.
Go to this directory, for example type:
(Note that the '%' is a shell prompt and must not be typed.)

	% cd cacd

First set the ICDPATH environment variable (the cacd install directory).
Normally, the current directory is also the install directory.
But you may choice another directory, in that case you must give an absolute
directory path in place of `pwd`. (This directory does not need to exist.
You must have write permission to create this directory.)

If you are working in a "csh" environment, type:

	% setenv ICDPATH `pwd`

If you are working in a "sh" environment, type:

	% export ICDPATH=`pwd`

All tools are installed in "$ICDPATH/bin" and libraries in "$ICDPATH/lib".
Some stuff is already installed in directory "$ICDPATH/share".

Note that "share/demo", "share/doc", "share/lib/process", "share/man" and
"share/tutorial" are already installed.
Directory "share" must be copied, if you choice to use another ICDPATH.
Note that no sources of documents are distributed (only .pdf files).
And that also no sources of "demo" and "tutorial" are distributed.

Before starting "make", your Linux PC must have the following libraries:

	libqt-mt (in "qt-3.3/lib" and "qt-3.3/bin/moc") for "spock",
	libX11 (and /usr/include/X11),
	libXaw (and /usr/include/X11/Xaw),
	libXm  (and /usr/include/Xm) for "simeye" and "helios",
	libXt  (the X toolkit library).

Normally, shared object (.so) libraries are used from "/usr/lib64".
Your PC also needs to have installed the GNU C-compiler (gcc, g++).

Before starting "make", you maybe want to edit the make file "src/Config.mk"
and/or "src/spice3/conf/linux64" and/or "src/spice3/conf/defaults".

To build and install all the tools, type:

	% make

To clean the "src" tree, type:

	% make clean

To uninstall all tools / libs, type:

	% make uninstall

See the Makefile.
Look carefully, if all the tools were built successfully.
If not, go to the tool "src" sub-directory and try to fix the problem
and try to make the tool there.

If you experience problems while performing these steps, please contact us.
See the section "Questions and bug reports" below.


Installing OP
-------------

To install OP (Ontwerp Practicum (IC Lab course)) you need to set the
environment variable OPPROGPATH. See also the "src/GoWithTheFlow/Makefile".
See also the OP manuals in "share/doc/opman" (manualEE2CL11_2017.pdf).
Default install path under the cacd-tree is "$ICDPATH/opprog".
To start using OP, you need to have a "bash" shell working environment.
To init OP "source $OPPROGPATH/bin/op_init" to get a correct ".bashrc" file.


Running the tools
-----------------

Set the environment variable ICDPATH, because it is used by some tools.
Add "$ICDPATH/bin" to your shell search path (environment variable PATH).
Or edit your "~/.cshrc" (or "~/.bashrc") file.
(Some tools require that "tclsh" or "wish" is installed on your PC.)

For example, add the following lines to your ".cshrc" file:

	% setenv ICDPATH $HOME/cacd
	% setenv PATH $ICDPATH/bin:$PATH

See also the "sourceme.csh" file or the "sourceme.bash" file.
Have a look at the documentation, which is in directory "share/doc".
Use tool 'icddoc' to view a document.  For example, type:

	% icddoc

Have also a look at the demos, for example:

	% cd $ICDPATH/share/demo/crand
	% ./script.sh

And have a look at the files of the space helios tutor:

	% cd $ICDPATH/share/tutorial

Tools are typically run from a project directory.  Such a project directory can
be created by using the program 'mkpr' (make project, see 'icdman mkpr').
For example, in order to create a project 'test', type:

	% mkpr test

Mkpr will ask for the process that should be chosen (the processes that are
available are listed in the file "$ICDPATH/share/lib/process/processlist") and
for the value of lambda (lambda is the grid - in microns - that will be used
for layout coordinates).

New processes can be added to the system as described in "process.pdf", type:

	% icddoc process.pdf

The value of lambda that is specified for a project should be small enough
in order to represent all valid layout positions.
Also, it should be not too small in order to prevent integer overflows for
large layouts. (Typical values for lambda are 0.1 - 0.001 micron.)

Alternatively, when you use the graphical user interface helios of space, you
can create a new project using the button `Database -> New ...' of helios, and
you can change to an already existing project using button `Database -> Open ...'.

A tutorial about the use of Space is found in the directory "share/doc", use

	% icddoc spacetutor_helios.pdf

for the case when you use the helios user interface to space.
And "spacetutor.pdf" for the case when you do not use helios.  Remember that
you can also consult the manual page of a tool, for example helios, type:

	% icdman helios


Running ICELLS
--------------
When you want to use the OCEAN fishbone process and celllibs, you need to run
the script ICELLS ones to install the celllibs. Be sure that your PATH include
the $ICDPATH/bin directory. This is also true if you want to use the OP program
GoWithTheFlow and this program is calling script mkvopr.


Running X-Windows programs
--------------------------

Sometimes you need first to set local access control enabled, type:

	% xhost local:


Questions and bug reports

Limitations
-----------

There are some known limitations of Space.  These are described in the manuals.
If you discover any other limitations of Space that are not mentioned in the
manual, please report them to the above address.
